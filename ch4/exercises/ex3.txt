"The C89 standard states that if either operand is negative, the
result of a division can be rounded either up or down. (For example
the value of -9 / 7 could be either -1 or -2).

If i or j is negative, the sign of i % j in C89 depends on the
implementation. (For example, the value of -9 % 7 could be either -2
or 5)."
