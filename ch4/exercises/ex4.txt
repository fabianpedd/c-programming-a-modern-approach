What is the value of each of the following expressions in C99? (Give
all possible values if an expression may have more than one value.)

a) 8 / 5
b) -8 / 5
c) 8 / -5
d) -8 / -5

--

In C99 ... the result of a division is always truncated toward zero
(so -9 / 7 has the value -1) and the value of i % j has the same sign
as i (hence the value of -9 % 7 is -2).

a) 1
b) -1
c) -1
d) 1
